## LongMap Implementations

This repository contains two implementations of the LongMap data structure, implemented in the `LongMapImpl` class. The task was to create a map with keys of type long, using a hash table approach similar to HashMap. The primary focus was on adhering to good coding style and test practices, as well as optimizing memory usage and ensuring adequate performance.

### Implementations

- `array-based-solution`: This implementation uses an array as the underlying data structure.
- `arraylist-based-solution`: This implementation uses an ArrayList as the underlying data structure.

You can switch between branches to explore the different implementations.
